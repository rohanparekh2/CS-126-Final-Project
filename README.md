**Description:** For my final project, I created a multiplayer baksetball game where each player gets to select what type of shot they want to take while on offense and what type of defense to play whil they are defending. The offensive player also gets to select their shot power. A shot that is closer to the basket requires lower power, while a farther shot requires higher power. I created an equation that takes the type of shot, defense, and power into account, and then randomizes the result to see if the shot is made. An animation showing if the shot is made will follow, and then the players switch sides. The game ends when one player reaches 10 points or someone presses the quit button.


**Controls:** Click a button on the screen to choose a shot

Press the spacebar to select the shot power

Press Return to move onto the next turn
