For my final project, I plan to create a mini basketball game.
I plan for it to be a two-player turn-based game, where the first
player picks the type of shot that they want to take. Each type of shot,
(layup, midrange, three-pointer, and half-court) will have a different
probability of being made, depending on the distance from the hoop.
To make the second player involved on defense, they will be able to choose
how they want to defend the shot (block, steal, contest). Choosing block or
steal will give the player a higher chance of making a shot, but also cause a
possible turnover. After both players pick their shot,
the player on offense will choose their power, which will be controlled
by a power meter that moves up and down. Longer shots need more power and the
power will also affect the probability of the shot-making.

I have extensive knowledge about basketball because I have played in a league
since I was in elementary school and I am an avid NBA fan.
I have also played games like 2k on console that are
obviously much more complicated than this but I have played
simpler mobile games too. I want to create this project
because I have been playing sports and sports video games for
my whole life, so it would be cool to make one of my own.

During week 1, I plan to create the interface of the project
by drawing the basketball court and the players and creating the scoreboard.
For the second week, I plan to implement the offensive part of the game
for both players. I will create the equations and buttons to display
the shot options. I will also create the power meter and make it so
that the player switches after every shot. For the third week,
I plan to set up the defensive part of the game by creating the options and buttons
for the player on defense. I will edit the equations to account for
the defensive player's choice.

If I finish the project early, I will probably add different shot
and defensive options. I could also add a meter that determines
the direction that the ball will go and add that to the equations.
I may also add some more stuff like a crowd to the background.
